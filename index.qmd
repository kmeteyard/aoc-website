I'm using this miji-site to host my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, 
released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

To see my solutions and notes, just click on the corresponding year in the top navigation bar. I plan on slowly filling out past years when I get the time. Currently, most solutions are in Python.

This website is created from the [EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template) template repository. 
There's documentation on how to use and adapt the template in the repo README.
