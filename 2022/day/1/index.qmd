## Setup

[The original challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

[My data](input){target="_blank"}

## Part 1

```{r}
input <- readLines('input.txt')

input <- as.numeric(input)

totals = c(0)
current = 0
for (i in input) {
  if (is.na(i)) {
    totals = append(totals, current)
    current = 0
    next
    
  }
    current = current + i
}
max(totals)
```

## Part 2

This is similar, except we want to find the sum of the sums of the top three groups.

```{r}
sum(sort(totals, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])
```
